Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address? 

Artemis Financial, a financial consultancy, has contracted us to create a secure web application for personalized financial planning.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

 I see value in performing static analysis to test code for vulnerabilities. Maintaining secure coding practices is essential to prevent data theft and protect the company's reputation.
 
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

 The dependency check tool was a lifesaver. It helped us quickly identify and resolve potential vulnerabilities, saving us time and ensuring a more secure application.
 
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?  

In the future, my plan is to incorporate penetration testing and keep myself informed about the latest security best practices.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

 I tested for functionality and security, reviewed the code, refactored it, and conducted thorough security testing to address any vulnerabilities.
 
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks? StackOverflow.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment? 

I want to showcase my web application security skills, including vulnerability assessments, to highlight my commitment to data protection and application integrity.
